After almost 3 months of coding bootcamp at neuefische.de, i learned a lot - but i also realized how little i do know. The world of coding seems to be unlimited.
That said, as our CapStone project to finish our bootcamp we had 4 weeks of time, to create a webApp. We came up with "My Trips" a personal App, designed for frequent travellers to plan, customize and keep track about their journeys.
Have a look at the Repo: [My Trips](https://github.com/miriam-ertl/my-trips) 

Team: [Bonnie](https://github.com/B-Baumeister), [Miriam](https://github.com/miriam-ertl), [Stephan](https://github.com/StephanBergmann)
